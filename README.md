# Compton-IBIS
python notebooks for analysis of INTEGRAL/IBIS Compton data, obtained from the Compton pipeline (not included here).

Required libraries: numpy, pandas, astropy, tqdm, matplotlib, scipy, lmfit.

# User guide

The saved_pola_df contains raw fluxes for different sources.

The first step is to choose the src name (ex: crab). The scw_file_name_list will contain the name of your runs (ex: ['all_2023']).

The next step allows you to make more selections on the scw you will use (date, angle, etcâ€¦).

The last step will build the polarigram and compute the associated Polarization Angle (PA) and Fraction (PF). This can be done for every energy bands and displayed on a plot.
