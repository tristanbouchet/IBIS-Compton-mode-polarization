This python notebooks was made for polarization analysis of pre-processed INTEGRAL/IBIS Compton data, obtained from the Compton pipeline (not included here).

Required libraries: numpy, pandas, astropy, tqdm, matplotlib, scipy, lmfit.

# User guide

The saved_pola_df contains raw fluxes for different sources.

The first step is to choose src (short-hand of the source name), while the scw_file_name_list will contain the name of your runs.

So far the only available data is for the 2023 outburst of MQ Swift J1727.8-1613 (see Bouchet et al. 2024, https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450826). More examples will be added in the future (Crab, Cygnus X-1).

The next step allows you to make more selections on the scw you will use (date, off-axis angle, revolutions, etcâ€¦).

The last step will build the polarigram and compute the associated Polarization Angle (PA) and Fraction (PF). This can be done for different energy bands and displayed on a plot.

NB: Some results may vary from reference papers since IBIS calibration files have been updated (especially after year 2020).
